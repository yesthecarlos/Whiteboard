Question #2: Array Deduping
Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Set objects are collections of unique values. (It can also store NaN and undefined.)

Example

Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi", 7, 53] (Fixed typo by adding comma after second "hi")

Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]

The most fun way to approach this is to extend the Array class (global object prototype) to include a "unique" method that creates a new Set from the array.

Array.prototype.unique = function(){
  return Array.from(new Set(this));
};

rawArray = [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi", 7, 53];

console.log(rawArray.unique());

You can also use the filter method to solve this:

function removeDuplicates(rawArray) {
  return rawArray.filter((value, index)=> rawArray.indexOf(value) === index);
}
